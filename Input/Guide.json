      "content": "<p > Welcome to the Science Education Alliance (SEA), a network of undergraduate researchers and instructors who collaborate on the PHAGES and GENES research projects. In the PHAGES project, researchers isolate novel bacteriophages from the environment by employing various techniques of microbiology, then fully annotate the bacteriophage genomes using an array of bioinformatic tools. Here, in the GENES project, researchers build on the discoveries of the PHAGES project, utilizing techniques of molecular biology and genetics to investigate the functions of genes encoded by these bacteriophages. </p> <h3 > Where are we headed? </h3> <p > The number of isolated phages with annotated genomes has increased by the thousands in recent years; this is made possible in part by undergraduate students who have contributed to the research enterprise through the SEA-PHAGES project. Their contributions have not only led to advances in our understanding of how genes are organized within phage genomes and distributed across phage populations, but has also revealed the incredible diversity of genes present within the phage population. When these genes are grouped into families based on the sequence similarities of the proteins they encode, to date, over twenty thousand unique families can be identified! Strikingly, the large majority of these families do not resemble any previously characterized proteins. Indeed, it is this remarkable and unexplored diversity that has earned bacteriophages the reputation as the “dark matter” of the biological world. These thousands of families of unknown functions thus represent a treasure trove from which to uncover novel biological functions. It is the aim of the SEA-GENES research project to experimentally explore this vast unknown. </p> <h3 > What might we find? </h3> <p > To consider this, it is important to revisit the details of a phage infection cycle, described in <a class='chap-linking'  tabindex='0' data-link-to='1-2' > Phage Infection Cycle Overview </a>, taking into account the myriad interactions that occur between the phage and its bacterial host. Phages have been co-evolving with the diversity of bacteria across the planet for eons, where each phage infection is a battle between the phage and its bacterial host for vital resources. Engaged in this high stakes arms race, both players have defense and counter-defense strategies that are continually evolving. The pursuit of gene-function elucidation therefore promises to uncover an arsenal of functions that reflect this ancient and on-going competition and shed new light on the intricacies of phage-host interactions. Such discoveries also hold the potential to greatly impact the fields of medicine and biotechnology. </p> <p > In medicine, particularly in an era of rampant antibiotic resistance, the phage gene pool is an invaluable resource for discovering novel strategies for controlling bacteria. Phage lysins, for example, are being developed as a strategy to treat bacterial infections, and recent studies of phage-host interactions are uncovering novel bacterial targets for the development of antimicrobials. In molecular biology, phage recombinases, as well as bacterial defense systems that target phage DNA, have enabled researchers to manipulate DNA with precision and make genetics modifications of cells in all domains of life. </p> <h3 > How do we elucidate gene-function? </h3> <p >‘Gene function’ refers to the specific role that a gene plays in an organism, which is determined by the structure of the final product it encodes, whether that be tRNA or, as in most cases, protein. This function can be complex, and is defined by all the work that a gene product performs. For example, a gene product may interact with an enzyme to catalyze a reaction that results in the production of a small molecule. A clear understanding of the role that a specific gene product performs cannot be gained from any one experiment, but instead requires the integration of multiple experimental approaches.</p> <p > There are several approaches that are routinely used to study the function of a gene product. These include bioinformatic inferences, phenotypic assays, and protein-protein interaction assays. Each of these approaches, described below, provides clues and preliminary insight that, when taken together, can be used to build a case for assigning function to a particular gene. Bioinformatic inferences have already been used, as part of the SEA-PHAGES project, to uncover phage gene function. Here, as part of the SEA-GENES project, phenotypic and protein-protein interaction assays will be used to gain experimental insights into phage gene function. </p> <ul role = 'list'> <li > <strong> Bioinformatic Inference.</strong> Gene-function studies often begin with bioinformatic inferences, where computer algorithms can be used to search for similarities between a gene of interest and other genes stored in databases. When strong similarities are identified to a gene with a known function, a gene of unknown function can be preliminarily assigned the same function. In the SEA-PHAGES project, phage genes were assigned functions based on similarity in sequence to genes and proteins of known function, using search tools such as BLAST, as well as on the order of genes within genomes, using tools such as Phamerator. The latter, called synteny, is based on a characteristic of phage and bacterial genomes in which genes that function in the same biological process often cluster together and maintain their relative positions on the genome. For a review of assigning functions using bioinformatic approaches, see the <a href = 'https://seaphagesbioinformatics.helpdocsonline.com/home' target = '_blank'> SEA-PHAGES Bioinformatics Guide </a>. </li> </ul> <ul role = 'list'> <li > <strong> Phenotypic Assays. </strong> The total and coordinated activity of all the genes expressed in an organism determines the observable traits and behavior, or phenotype<b>,</b> of that organism. As gene expression changes, so can its phenotype. The connection between gene expression and phenotypes is not only a fundamental tenet of biology; it is also central in the quest to study gene function. Phenotypic assays are a common strategy that involves altering gene expression in some way, either by turning it off completely, turning it on when it would not normally be expressed, or increasing or decreasing the amount of expression, and observing for a change in phenotype. An observable phenotypic change in response to the altered gene expression can provide important clues as to the role that gene plays. For example, expression of a phage gene in a bacterium may result in inhibition of bacterial growth, which suggests its involvement in a process essential for bacterial growth. This approach will be employed as part of the SEA-GENES project, and is described further in Chapter 3.</li> </ul> <ul role = 'list'> <li > <strong> Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Assays.</strong> PPI assays are employed to identify proteins that interact with one another. As proteins often do not function in isolation, but instead typically interact with other proteins as part of biological processes, PPI assays can be used to infer the function of one protein if the function of the interacting partner identified is known. For example, identifying a transcription factor as one interacting partner suggests that other protein may also be involved in transcription. This approach will be employed as part of the SEA-GENES project, and is described further in Chapter 4.</li> </ul> <h3 > SEA-GENES Research Workflow </h3><table> <thead><tr><th>Sequence</th><th colspan='2' rowspan='1'>Description of Research</tr></thead><tbody>  <tr> <td>1</td> <td><img src='./assets/images/welcome.svg' alt='First step of SEA-GENES Research Workflow' /></td> <td> Molecular cloning techniques will be used to engineer a system that enables<br> each gene of a mycobacteriophage to be expressed, individually, in <em>M.<br> smegmatis</em> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td><img src='./assets/images/molecular-cloning.svg' alt='Second step of SEA-GENES Research Workflow'/></td> <td> Each gene of a mycobacteriophage will be expressed, individually, in <em>M. <br>smegmatis</em> to identify those that are able to modify the behavior, or phenotype, of <br>the bacterium. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td><img src='./assets/images/phenotypic-assay.svg' alt='Third step of SEA-GENES Research Workflow'/></td> <td> Molecular cloning techniques will be used to engineer a second system that<br> enables specific mycobacteriophage genes identified by phenotypic assays to be <br> expressed, individually, in <em>E. coli.</em> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td><img src='./assets/images/interaction-assay.svg' alt='Fourth step of SEA-GENES Research Workflow' /></td> <td> Mycobacteriophage genes will be expressed in an <em>E. coli </em> protein-protein <br> interaction assay to identify potential interacting partners from the <em>M.<br> smegmatis </em>proteome. </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"

      "content": "<p >A phage infection cycle can be broken down into 6 stages. A clear understanding of the strategies employed by phages to complete each infection stage and to counter bacterial defense systems is key to the study of phage-gene function. It provides a framework for anticipating functions that are likely to be encoded in the phage genome. For example, understanding that phages must degrade the bacterial cell wall at the end of the infection cycle then suggests that its genome is likely to encode for enzymes to accomplish that function. Described below are the stages of an infection cycle, many with examples of defense and counter defense strategies employed by bacteria and phages.</p> <h3>1. Adsorption</h3> <p >The first step of phage infection is attachment of a phage particle to the surface of its bacterial host, a process called adsorption. Adsorption is accomplished by phage-encoded <b>R</b>eceptor <b>B</b>inding <b>P</b>roteins (RBPs). On tailed phages, the RBPs are typically a component of the phage tail. These RBPs recognize specific structures of the host cell surface, enabling phages to not only attach to its hosts, but to also distinguish its hosts from other bacteria. </p> <p >However, accessing these host cell surface receptors is not always trivial. For instance, the bacterial cell surface may be decorated with polysaccharides that can occlude the cell surface receptor. In fact, this appears to be a strategy employed by bacteria to evade phage infection. In turn, phages can encode polysaccharide degrading enzymes, often also as part of the phage tail, to unmask its cell surface receptor.</p> <h3 >2. Genome Delivery</h3> <p >Successful adsorption then sets in motion the delivery of phage DNA from the capsid into the host cell. To achieve this, phages must clear a path and assemble a channel across the cell envelope. Phages encode enzymes such as peptidases and glycosidases to breakdown the rigid peptidoglycan cell wall, and specialized proteins to form a channel for DNA delivery. For myoviruses with contractile tails, this channel is formed by a preassembled tail-tube that emerges upon contraction of the tail. For podoviruses with short non-contractile tails, specialized tail proteins likely assemble <i>de novo </i>to form a channel across the cell envelope.</p>  <p >Once delivered into the host cell, phage DNA must evade degradation by host nucleases. For example, commonly encoded bacterial exonucleases target the double-stranded ends of linear phage genomes. To protect against these exonucleases, phages encode recombinases that join the two ends of its genome to form a circular DNA molecule. Phages that do not circularize their genomes encode proteins that either bind to and protect the ends of its linear DNA, or bind to the exonucleases and prevent their recognition of its DNA ends. Bacteria also encode at least two defense systems that utilize endonucleases to target phage DNA - the restriction-modification (RM) system and the CRISPR system. In both of these systems, bacterial endonucleases surveil the cell for specific “target” DNA sequences that, upon encountering, it cleaves to expose double-stranded DNA ends that can then be degraded by exonucleases. In the RM system, the endonucleases are called restriction enzymes. Because the host DNA may also contain these target sequences, the host encodes modification enzymes, such as methyl-transferases, to modify and thereby mask target sequences that may occur on its own DNA. Phages can similarly evade restriction enzymes by encoding their own modification enzymes, as well as proteins that stimulate the activity of host modification enzymes, to rapidly modify and thereby protect phage DNA. Phages can also encode proteins that, when co-delivered into the host cell with its DNA, either bind to and protect target sequences that occur on its genome, or act like decoys by binding to and sequestering the host restriction enzymes. In the CRISPR system, the endonucleases are called <b>C</b>RISPR-<b>as</b>sociated (Cas) proteins. Cas proteins target DNA sequences that are specified by a region of host DNA called CRISPR. Phages can inactivate CRISPR-Cas systems by encoding <b>a</b>nti-<b>CR</b>ISPR (<b>acr</b>) proteins that inhibit the ability of Cas proteins to target or cleave DNA, or their own CRISPR-Cas system that targets and cleaves host CRISPR DNA.</p> <h3>3. Macromolecular Synthesis</h3> <p >Immediately upon delivery of phage DNA into the cell, and while evading nucleases, phage gene expression and genome replication begins. </p> <p><strong>3a. Gene Expression.</strong>Transcription of phage genes is often initiated by host RNA polymerase and completed by either host or phage-encoded RNA polymerase, while translation is primarily executed by host translation machinery. For a productive infection, phage gene expression must be tightly regulated, and phages encode a myriad of proteins to regulate gene expression.</p> <p >At the level of transcription, phages encode transcription regulators that, by enabling, promoting, or repressing transcription from given promoters, can not only modulate the levels of expression, but can also exert temporal control over gene expression. These transcription regulators can also completely inhibit the activity of host RNA polymerase, a strategy employed by phages to prevent transcription of host genes, thereby maximizing host recourses for transcription of phage genes.  </p><p> Phage-encoded proteins are also able to modulate gene expression at the level of translation. For example, phages can encode mRNA-binding proteins to stabilize transcripts or occlude ribosome binding, or ribonucleases that target transcripts for degradation. Phages can also encode their own tRNAs, or proteins that modify tRNAs, which alter the cellular pool of these molecules and may facilitate translation of phage genes. </p>  <p  > In defense, host-encoded proteins can also inhibit phage gene expression, with phages often equipped to counter these bacterial defense strategies. For example, when host gene expression is inhibited by an infecting phage, the relative amounts of a host-encoded transcript-cleaving toxin, which is more stable than the co-expressed host-encoded anti-toxin, increases. These “free” toxins can then promote the degradation of transcripts to shutdown phage gene expression. To counter such <b>T</b>oxin-<b>A</b>nti-toxin (TA) systems, phages can encode their own anti-toxins, which can bind to and neutralize the host toxins. As another means of defense, bacterial proteins can cleave tRNAs to inhibit translation. In turn, phages can restore translation by encoding polynucleotide kinase, phosphatase, and RNA ligase to repair cleaved tRNA. </p>  <p  > <strong>3b. Genome Replication.</strong> Replication of phage genomes is often performed by both host and phage-encoded replication proteins such as DNA polymerase, helicase, and primase. As with transcription, phages can also encode proteins that specifically inhibit replication of the host genome as means to maximize reserves for replication of its own genome. Indeed, phages can also encode nucleases that degrade the host genome as well as enzymes that catalyze nucleotide formation to increase the pool of nucleotides available for phage genome replication. Phages that degrade host genomes also encode proteins that modify and protects its own DNA from degradation. </p> <p  > <strong>3c. Lysogeny.</strong><b> </b>At an early stage of macromolecular synthesis, temperate phages have the unique ability to pause their infection cycle and adopt a different pattern of gene expression and genome replication. This state, called lysogeny, is achieved when the phage-encoded immunity repressor is expressed and able to continually inhibit transcription from promoters that are critical for a productive infection. The decision to enter lysogeny, and indeed the duration of lysogeny, is determine by host and phage-encoded proteins that modulate the expression or activity of the immunity repressor in response to environmental stimuli. These include host-encoded proteins that sense DNA damage, and phage-encoded receptors that can detect the amount of host bacteria or active infections in the immediate environment. </p> <p  > During lysogeny, phages must also ensure that their genomes are faithfully replicated and stably segregated as the host cells continue to grow and divide. To achieve this, phages typically insert their genomes into the host chromosome. This integration is performed by phage-encoded recombinases, called integrases. When phages resume a productive infection, the same integrases acts in concert with phage-encoded excisionases to excise phage genomes from the host chromosome. Non-integrating phages, on the other hand, maintain their genomes extra-chromosomally, like a very large plasmid, during lysogeny. These phages encode partitioning proteins that help ensure their genomes, once replicated, are properly partitioned as the host cell divides. These partitioning proteins include centromere proteins and actin- or tubulin-like polymerizing proteins that bind to and actively segregate phage DNA, respectively. </p><h3> 4. Host Immunity  </h3> <p  > During the course on an infection, phages may promote survival of the infected host. For example, immunity repressor proteins expressed during lysogeny are able to recognize and similarly repress gene expression of identical or similar superinfecting phages. Indeed, phages can employ a variety of strategies to immunize its host from superinfection. For example, phage-encoded proteins can prevent superinfection by identical or similar phages by occluding cell surface receptors or by inhibiting cell wall degrading enzymes required for invasion. Phages can also provide immunity against more distantly related phages, for example, by encoding restriction enzymes that target successfully delivered phage DNA for degradation. </p> <h3 > 5. Assembly  </h3> <p  > Towards the end of a productive infection cycle, the components of new phage particles begin to accumulate in the host. In stages, these components begin assembling into new phage particles; scaffolding proteins and chaperones guide assembly of capsid proteins into capsids, and the numerous tail proteins into tail tubes and tail fibers, while packaging proteins such as terminase and portal proteins package phage genomes into capsids. Finally, connector and adapter proteins bridge these preassembled parts to form mature phage particles. </p>  <h3> 6. Release  </h3> <p  > As new phage particles accumulate in the host, so do phage-encoded proteins that are important for the final act of an infection cycle – phage release from the host. Accumulating holin proteins associate with the host cell membrane to form holes, through which lysins, with various hydrolase activities, can access and degrade the cell wall. This combined activity results in cell lysis and the release of phage particles that can begin new infection cycles.  </p>"

Once cleaned, the work surface should then be wiped-down with 70 % ethanol to remove residual disinfectant from the surface.<br> Note: As a disinfectant, 70 % EtOH is sufficient to kill most bacterial contaminants on surfaces. However, it is not effective on Mycobacteria because of the mycolic acid wall. Use of a disinfectant like CiDecon will remove mycobacterial contaminants.</li> <li>Materials that have come in contact with bacteria and that are intended for reuse (e.g. glass flasks) should be treated with CiDecon before washing.

The growth of contaminating bacteria, fungi, and viruses can be avoided by disinfecting your bench, creating an updraft with a Bunsen burner, and moving with care and deliberation. When working with DNA and molecular biology techniques, it is essential to disinfect your bench and to ALWAYS wear gloves and a lab coat in order to reduce the chances of introducing contaminating DNA or degrading nucleases into your sample.</p> <p>The information provided in this document is adapted from the SEA-PHAGES Phage Discovery Guide and Phage Discovery Instructors Guide © 2018, Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>"

      "content": "<h3>Plasmids and Gene Expression in Bacteria</h3> <p>A typical bacterial genome is 5 million base pairs (5 Mbp) in length, though genomes as small as 0.1 Mbp and as large as 14 Mbp have been reported. In most bacteria, these millions of DNA base pairs are arranged as a single double-stranded, circular chromosome that is organized into genes encoding for several thousand different proteins. The <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> genome contains ~ 7 Mbp, organized into 6,717 genes. As bacteria grow and divide, the chromosome is copied by the replication machinery and partitioned into the two resulting daughter cells, ensuring stable maintenance of all chromosomal genes.</p> <p>Not all of the genes in a bacterial cell are necessarily found on this chromosome; bacteria can carry additional genes on DNA molecules known as plasmids, which<b> </b>like the chromosome, are also replicated and partitioned as bacteria grow and divide. Plasmids are small, circular molecules of dsDNA that are typically less than 10 kbp and contain just a handful of genes. Owing to its small size, plasmids are easily engineered and manipulated in the lab and can be made to contain almost any genetic sequence imaginable. The process of building a plasmid is known as molecular cloning and is described in the next section. For SEA-GENES, two plasmids have been engineered to facilitate the study of gene function, pExTra and p2H&alpha;, which you will manipulate to contain your phage gene of interest (Figure 2.01).</p> <p> All plasmids, including those that exist in nature or that have been created in a lab, contain two key features. The first, the origin of replication, contains all the necessary elements that enable replication of the plasmid, including the DNA sequence where replication is initiated by the bacterial machinery. The origin of replication for a plasmid thus determines the bacterial hosts in which the plasmid can be replicated and maintained. The pExTra plasmid has two origins of replication, enabling it to be replicated in <i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>M. smegmatis, </i>whereas the p2H&alpha; plasmid can only be replicated in <i>E. coli.</i> The second feature common to all plasmids is a gene that confers some type of advantage to the plasmid-containing cell, which in turn helps to ensure that the plasmid is maintained within a bacterial population. Oftentimes this advantageous gene encodes for antibiotic resistance, allowing the plasmid-containing cell to survive in the presence of a given antibiotic. In the lab, this feature can be used to identify and isolate, or select, bacteria that contain the specific plasmid from cells that do not. The pExTra and p2H&alpha; plasmids confer resistance to the antibiotics Kanamycin and Spectinomycin, respectively.<br> </p> <div class='img-wrap'> <div class='img-container'> <img src='./assets/images/c2-plasmid-maps.png' alt='This image contains two colored circles; one labeled p-extra and one labeled p-two-h-alpha. The p-extra circle has 6 colored and labeled regions in the following order. p-tet, m-cherry reporter, kanamycin resistance gene, e-coli origin of replication, tet repressor, and m-smegmatis origin of replication. Phage gene insertion site is marked with an arrow pointing to a spot on the circle between p-tet and m-cherry reporter. The p-two-h-alpha circle has 4 colored and labeled regions in the following order. p-lac-asterix, alpha domain, e-coli origin of replication, and spectinomycin resistance gene. Phage gene insertion site is marked with an arrow pointing to a spot on the circle immediately after alpha domain.' /> </div>  <div class='img-hr'></div><div class='title-container'>   Figure 2.01. pExTra and p2H&alpha; plasmid maps </div> </div> <p> In addition to these two features, the pExTra and p2H&alpha; plasmids have been engineered to each contain a promoter, which is a DNA sequence that is recognized and bound by RNA polymerase. Once bound at the promoter, RNA polymerase can initiate transcription of the gene(s) immediately downstream of the promoter. In SEA-GENES research, and as part of Chapter 2, you will manipulate pExTra and p2H&alpha; plasmids to contain your phage gene of interest immediately downstream of the promoter. By doing so, you will create a means to express your phage gene of interest in bacteria to begin exploring phage gene function as part of the research outlined in chapters 3 and 4. </p> <h4>Molecular Cloning Techniques for the Construction of Plasmids</h4> <p> The pExTra and p2H&alpha; plasmids will be modified using a process known as molecular cloning, which is a set of experimental methods for the assembly, isolation, and propagation of recombinant DNA plasmids. 'Recombinant' simply means that these DNA molecules are composed of a mixture of sequences from different sources and would not naturally occur. For example, the recombinant pExTra plasmids we will build will contain sequences originally from mycobacteriophage, bacteria, naturally occurring plasmids, and sea anemones! Since the advent of molecular cloning in the 1970s, researchers have developed a number of cloning technologies and workflows that enable efficient engineering of DNA molecules such as plasmids. The workflows that we will use to clone phage genes into pExTra and p2H&alpha; plasmids are described in detail in Protocol 2.1a and Protocol 2.1b, and are composed of the following 4 core steps. </p> <p> <strong>Step 1.</strong> Copying and isolating a particular DNA fragment referred to as an 'insert'. </p> <p> <strong>Step 2.</strong> Assembling the insert with a relevant plasmid, which in the context of cloning is referred to as a 'plasmid backbone.' </p> <p> <strong>Step 3.</strong> Introducing the new recombinant plasmid into bacteria by a process known as 'transformation' and selecting bacteria carrying the plasmid. </p> <p> <strong>Step 4.</strong> Purifying the recombinant plasmid and verifying that it contains the correct insert. </p> <p> <strong> Step 1. Copying and isolating a particular DNA fragment referred to as an 'insert'. </strong> <br /> Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR, is a powerful technique that allows a specific fragment of DNA to be copied exponentially, <i>in vitro</i>, generating large quantities of DNA from very little starting DNA (Figure 2.02). </p> <div class='img-wrap'> <div class='img-container'> <img src='./assets/images/figure-2-02-a-phage-gene-of-interest.png' alt='The image is of a multi-faceted geometric shape with a black line emerging from one point.

In the middle of the thick blue arrow is a small black arrow pointing down to a grouping of 18 similar thick, blue arrows.' /> </div>  <div class='img-hr'></div><div class='title-container'>   Figure 2.02. A phage gene of interest is copied, or 'amplified', by PCR. </div> </div> <p>PCR requires several key components:</p> <table> <thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Description of Component</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr> <td>Template DNA</td> <td> DNA sample that contains the sequence to be copied.

Reaction components are mixed together and placed in a thermocycler machine, which cycles through these three temperatures, usually 20-40 times. During each cycle of denaturation, annealing, and extension, the specific segment of DNA is amplified exponentially. Exact temperatures and times for these steps are influenced by primer sequence, DNA length, and the polymerase used.<br /> </p> <table> <thead><tr><th>PCR Step</th><th>Temp.</th><th>Duration</th><th>Description of step</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr> <td>Denaturation</td> <td>94 - 98 °C</td> <td>5 -10 sec</td> <td> High temperature denatures the two strands of the <br> template DNA. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Annealing</td> <td>50 -72 °C</td> <td>5 sec</td> <td> The temperature is lowered, allowing the primers to bind <br> to the complementary region of the template DNA strand. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Extension</td> <td>68 - 72 °C</td> <td>10 - 30 sec per kb of amplified segment</td> <td> DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the end of each <br> annealed primer (in the 5' to 3' direction) to build a new <br> double stranded copy of the segment. </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br> <p> The result of a PCR reaction can be assessed by gel electrophoresis, a technique in which DNA is passed through an agarose gel by an electric current. Negatively charged DNA molecules migrate through the sieve-like matrix according to their size, allowing for separation of DNA molecules based on their size. When visualized using a DNA dye such as ethidium bromide, DNA molecules will appear as bands whose size can be determined by comparison to a standard of known sizes, or 'ladder'. Usually, the desired result of a PCR reaction is a single band of the correct size; however, in some cases a PCR may yield multiple bands or no bands, requiring further optimization. It is necessary to purify the desired PCR product away from the other components of the reaction as they may interfere with downstream assembly steps. This can be done by washing the entire reaction over a commercially available silica column or first extracting a specific band of DNA from an agarose gel and washing that over a column. </p> <p> Once an insert has been generated by PCR and purified, it can be assembled with a plasmid backbone using a variety of methods, each of which requires modification of the ends of the inserts. In SEA-GENES we will utilize two assembly strategies, which are described below. </p> <p> <h4> Step 2. Assembling the insert with a relevant plasmid, which in the context of cloning is referred to as a 'plasmid backbone.' </h4> There are two strategies that will be employed for the assembly reaction, either restriction enzyme digest and ligation, or isothermal assembly. </p> <p> <strong>Restriction enzyme digestion (RED) and ligation.</strong> Assembling an insert and plasmid backbone by RED and ligation can essentially be thought of as a 'cut and paste' reaction that takes two linear DNA molecules and joins them to form a single circular molecule. The 'cut' is performed by restriction endonuclease enzymes, which recognize and cleave double-stranded DNA at specific 4–6 bp palindromic sequences called restriction sites. Some restriction enzymes cleave both strands at the same site, generating 'blunt ends', whereas other enzymes cleave the strands at different locations a few bp away from each other, generating single-stranded 'sticky ends.' These sticky ends allow for efficient binding of two pieces of DNA with complementary overhangs. To create compatible ends, the insert and plasmid should be digested with the same restriction enzyme and thus, must have the same restriction sites. If not already present, primers can be designed to introduce desired restriction sites to the ends of an insert sequence (flanking the gene) by PCR. Similarly, plasmids can be modified to contain necessary restriction sites, and often have several that can be used for cloning in a region known as the 'multiple cloning site.' Cleavage of a circular plasmid molecule by one or more restriction enzymes creates a linear plasmid backbone with appropriate ends for assembly. Digestion of the insert and plasmid with two different restriction enzymes (known as a double digest) ensures proper directional assembly. Some restriction sites occur naturally within gene sequences or plasmid sequences; when designing a cloning strategy, it is essential that restriction sites be unique within the insert and plasmid such that the right number of fragments of the correct size are generated upon digestion. </p> <p> The 'paste' step is achieved by the enzyme DNA ligase, which covalently connects the sugar phosphate backbones of two DNA molecules with complementary sticky ends generated by restriction enzyme digest. Interestingly, the ligase enzyme used for this reaction is from the phage T4! Together, these two enzymatic steps produce a recombinant plasmid that is ready for transformation into bacteria. </p> <div class='img-wrap'> <div class='img-container'> <img src='./assets/images/figure-2-03-Insert-dna-plasmid.png' alt='This image includes the grouping of 18 thick, blue arrows followed by an addition symbol followed by a color-coded circle with an antibiotic resistance gene, an origin of replication and a promter with a gap at the top of the circle. An arrow points from this circle to another with the same labels and a thick blue arrow that was part of the grouping at the beginning filling the gap in the circle. ' /> </div>  <div class='img-hr'></div><div class='title-container'>   Figure 2.03. 'Insert' DNA and prepared plasmid 'backbone' DNA are assembled into a new plasmid. </div> </div> <p> <strong>Isothermal Assembly.</strong> Similar to RED and ligation, isothermal assembly 'cuts and pastes' together multiple linear DNA fragments. This method is an attractive alternative to RED and ligation cloning as it involves fewer individual steps and does not require DNA segments to have specific, unique restriction sites. However, it does require that the DNA segments have identical, overlapping sequences known as 'homology regions' at both ends; these homology regions should be at least 20 bp in length. As in the above strategy, primers can be engineered to introduce these homology regions into the insert or plasmid backbone by PCR, providing the necessary sequence match. Circular plasmids must be linearized for use in isothermal assembly; this is usually achieved by amplifying the plasmid by PCR, creating a linear plasmid backbone with the homology regions situated at the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends. </p> <p> In an isothermal assembly reaction, three enzymatic steps occur in a single tube during a single incubation step at 50 ºC: </p> <ol role = 'list'> <li> An exonuclease chews back double stranded DNA at each 5' end, leaving 3' overhangs or 'sticky ends'. The exonuclease is quickly inactivated at 50 ºC. This ensures that only the DNA ends are digested, not the entire strand. Since the two DNA segments have overlapping sequences at their ends, the sticky ends that are generated can base pair to each other, allowing the two different DNA segments to anneal to each other. This base pairing is very efficient due to the extended length of the sticky ends—much more efficient than the base pairing of sticky ends generated by restriction enzyme digest, which are typically only a few bp long. </li> <li>DNA Polymerase fills in the gaps on the annealed segments, and</li> <li> DNA ligase covalently links the sugar phosphate backbones, creating a complete DNA molecule ready for bacterial transformation. </li> </ol> <h4> Step 3. Introducing the new recombinant plasmid into bacteria by a process known as 'transformation' and selecting bacteria carrying the plasmid. </h4> <p> Transformation is the process of introducing a plasmid into bacterial cells. Cells that are capable of taking up a piece of foreign DNA are said to be 'competent.' Transformation is an essential step in molecular cloning of plasmids, as the bacterial cells are used to recover the cloned plasmid of interest from a ligation or isothermal assembly reaction. Transformed cells are also used to store and replicate the plasmid. Although many species of bacteria are or can be engineered to be competent, <i>E. coli</i> is the true workhorse of molecular cloning. <i>E. coli</i> grows quickly (optimally, doubling every~ 20 min) and is relatively easy to work with. As such, molecular biologists have modified the <i>E. coli </i>genome to facilitate its ability to take up and stably store recombinant plasmid DNA. For instance, many cloning strains have a mutation in the <i>endA</i> gene, disrupting the function of the encoded endonuclease and protecting plasmid molecules from degradation. </p> <p>To transform bacteria, plasmid DNA is incubated with an ice-cold mixture of competent cells and glycerol. The plasmid molecules can be introduced into the cells by one of two methods: heat shock or electroporation. In the heat shock method, competent cells are treated with divalent cations (such as CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and briefly incubated at a high temperature (42 ºC); this creates pores in the membrane that the plasmid can travel through. Similarly, in the electroporation method, membrane pores are created by pulsing cells with an electric current. Although transformation is an efficient method, not all cells will take up the DNA. In both methods, transformed bacteria that have taken up the plasmid of interest must be 'selected' for based on the antibiotic resistance conferred by the plasmid. This is achieved by plating the transformation mixture on solid medium containing a selective concentration of antibiotic; only those cells that have successfully taken up and replicated the recombinant plasmid are able to grow.</p><div class='img-wrap'> <div class='img-container'> <img src='./assets/images/figure-2-04-during-a-transformation-reaction.png' alt='A color-coded circle with labels antibiotic resistance gene, origin of replication, promter and a thick, blue arrow is followed by an addition symbol followed by a grouping of 8 oblong shapes followed by an arrow pointing to another grouping of 8 oblong shapes, three of which contain the color-coded circles at the beginning.' /> </div>  <div class='img-hr'></div><div class='title-container'>   Figure 2.04. During a transformation reaction, a fraction of bacteria will take up the DNA. These bacteria are said to be 'transformed'. </div> </div> <h4> Step 4. Purifying the recombinant plasmid and verifying that it contains the correct insert. </h4> <p> Once the transformed <i>E. coli</i> cells harboring the plasmid clone have formed colonies on an antibiotic selection plate, it is necessary to purify the recombinant plasmid and verify that it was constructed correctly before it is used in any downstream experiments. To purify the plasmid, cells are grown to high density in selective liquid medium then lysed by the addition of SDS and NaOH, which denatures all DNA (chromosomal and plasmid) in the sample. This process, known as alkaline lysis, allows for separation of plasmid DNA from chromosomal DNA; upon neutralization of the alkaline solution, plasmid molecules are re-natured, whereas strands of chromosomal DNA are unable to re-anneal and become an insoluble aggregate that precipitates out of solution. Plasmid DNA can then be bound to a silica column, washed to remove salts, proteins and other contaminants, and eluted with sterile, nuclease-free water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O). </p> <div class='img-wrap'> <div class='img-container'> <img src='./assets/images/figure-2-05-bacteria-containing.png' alt='An arrow is pointing from eleven oblong shapes containing circles with green and blue markers to a four by four grid of the circles with the blue and green markers.' /> </div>  <div class='img-hr'></div><div class='title-container'>   Figure 2.05. Bacteria containing a plasmid can be grown to high denstities, from which large quantities of the plasmid can be extracted for use in downsteam applications. </div> </div> <p> There are multiple methods that can be used to confirm that a recombinant plasmid contains the expected insert. The exact sequence of nucleotides in the insert-containing region of the plasmid can be precisely determined by a DNA sequencing technique known as Sanger sequencing. Alternatively, PCR and gel electrophoresis can be used diagnostically to determine whether a plasmid contains an insert of the expected size. One benefit of the latter method is that the plasmid does not need to be purified from cells before running the diagnostic; a transformed colony can be used directly as PCR template. In a typical cloning workflow multiple candidate clones are tested for a correct insert, and verifying a plasmid clone prior to going through the purification process can conserve time and reagents. </p> <p> Once a plasmid has been purified and verified, it is ready for use in the experimental procedures outlined in Chapters 3 or 4! </p>"

DNA molecules are loaded onto an agarose gel and exposed to an electric current. The DNA molecules migrate through the sieve-like agarose gel due to their inherent negative charge; smaller DNA molecules move more easily, and therefore more quickly, than larger DNA molecules through the gel. The agarose gel contains a dye that binds to DNA and allows the DNA molecules that have now been separated by size to be visualized under ultraviolet light.

      "content": " <h3>Objective:</h3> <p> To introduce plasmid DNA into bacterial cells.</p> <h4>Rationale:</h4> <p>Transformation is the process of introducing a piece of DNA, typically a plasmid, into bacterial cells. Once transformed, bacterial cells store and replicate the plasmid as it does its own genetic material. In molecular cloning, plasmids that are assembled <em>in vitro</em>, for example by isothermal assembly or DNA ligation, are transformed into bacteria so that the plasmid can be replicated. Transformed bacteria, when grown to high densities, can therefore be used to generate large quantities of plasmid DNA, which can subsequently be extracted. Transformations are also an important technique for introducing specific genes into bacteria in order to study gene function.</p> <p >In chemical transformation, plasmid DNA is mixed with bacterial cells, and this mixture is briefly incubated at a high temperature. This 'heat shock' allows plasmid DNA to enter the cells. During a transformation reaction, not all bacterial cells will be transformed with DNA. However, those bacteria that have been transformed with plasmid DNA can readily be selected based on antibiotic resistance conferred by the plasmid. To select transformed bacteria, bacterial cells from the transformation reaction are allowed to grow for an hour such that transformed cells begin expressing the antibiotic resistance gene, and all cells are then plated on agar supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.

      "content": "<p>Chapter 2 guided you through the process of cloning a phage gene of interest into the plasmid, pExTra. In this chapter, the recombinant plasmid you built and purified will serve as an important tool in your research to investigate the function of this gene. Through the process of transformation by electroporation (Protocol 3.1), this plasmid will be introduced into <i>M. smegmatis</i>, the bacterial host of the mycobacteriophages encoding our genes of interest. pExTra was specifically engineered to enable the controlled expression of our phage genes in <i>M. smegmatis</i>, allowing us to ask the question: what happens when a particular phage gene is expressed in the host cell? The combined efforts of you and your fellow researchers will enable investigation of this research question on a genome-wide scale.</p> <h3> From genes to phenotype </h3> <p>As in all organisms, the expression of genes in bacteria, whether they are found on the bacterial chromosome, on a plasmid, or on an infecting phage genome, follows the central dogma: RNA polymerase transcribes the DNA gene sequence into an RNA molecule which is then translated into a peptide chain of amino acids by the ribosome. This amino acid sequence dictates the 3D structure that a peptide chain adopts; this in turn dictates that protein’s function, or the work that it performs in a cell. Together, the coordinated activities of the various proteins that are produced by an organism, determine the observable traits and behavior, or phenotype of that organism. In short, an organism’s phenotype reflects the set of genes being expressed. As the set of genes being expressed in an organism changes, so can the phenotype. For example, during phage infection of a bacterial cell, the expression of phage genes often changes the phenotype of the infected bacterial cell.</p> <h3> Manipulating gene expression to study phage gene function </h3> <p>The connection between gene expression and observable traits is not only a fundamental tenet of biology; it is also a valuable research tool in the quest to understand the function of a gene. By manipulating gene expression in some way and looking for an observable change in the organism, we can begin to associate the gene with processes it is involved in and thereby gather clues as to its function. The expression of a gene can be altered in various ways, either by turning it off completely, turning it on when it would not normally be expressed, or increasing or decreasing the amount of expression. In our investigation, we will express a given mycobacteriophage gene from the pExTra plasmid in the host cell and observe if and how it alters the host phenotype. To some extent, this approach<i> </i>mimics a typical phage infection of a mycobacterial cell, though with some key differences; for example, other phage gene products that may regulate or contribute to the function of our gene of interest will not be present in the cell. We know that many phage gene products manipulate host processes in some way in order to promote phage survival and propagation; consequently, we expect to observe some of the phenotypes that are typically observed during a phage infection, including growth inhibition of the host cell. Expression of the phage gene by itself allows us to ascribe any phenotypic change to the specific phage gene being studied</p> <p>For controlled expression of the phage gene, and for careful assessment of gene expression, the pExTra plasmid was engineered with two features:<br> 1. a promoter that allows gene expression to be turned on and off, and<br> 2. a reporter gene that indicates when expression is occurring.</p> <h3> 1. The pExTra inducible promoter </h3> <p>A promoter is a DNA sequence that controls transcription of the gene(s) immediately downstream. Bacterial promoters are typically composed of two 6 bp long sequences, referred to as the -10 and -35 sites, to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate gene transcription. If RNA polymerase can access a given promoter at all times, and thereby initiate transcription continuously, the promoter is said to be constitutively ‘on’. However, many promoters are regulated by additional factors and are only ‘on’ under specific conditions. Such promoters are known as inducible promoters and can be either negatively or positively regulated.</p> <p>In a negatively-regulated promoter, a repressor protein binds to a DNA sequence near or within the promoter DNA, known as an operator site. The bound repressor prevents access to the promoter by RNA polymerase, thereby maintaining the promoter in the ‘off’ state. pExTra plasmids contain a Tetracycline-inducible or ‘Tet’ promoter upstream of the phage gene sequence. This promoter is maintained in the “off” state by the tetracycline-repressor protein, TetR, and can be turned “on” by the addition of the molecule tetracycline. Tetracycline binds TetR, causing a conformational change that releases the repressor from the DNA, thereby enabling access to the promoter by RNA polymerase. Because tetracycline turns “on” the promoter and thereby “induces” gene expression, tetracycline is known as an inducer. In our experiments, we will use a chemically modified form of tetracycline as the inducer, known as anhydrotetracycline, aTc. As illustrated in the plasmid map in Protocol 2.1a, the gene encoding TetR is also found on pExTra, and the repressor is constitutively produced, ensuring that phage gene expression is tightly repressed until the aTc inducer is introduced into our experimental system.</p> <p>As a side note, the plasmid that we will employ in Chapter 4 contains a different negatively-regulated promoter, the ‘Lac*’ promoter, which is repressed by the transcriptional regulator LacI and induced by the chemical Isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). We will also utilize a positively regulated promoter in Chapter 4, in which ‘activator’ proteins recruit RNA polymerase to a promoter to initiate transcription. This positively-regulated promoter will be described in Chapter 4.</p> <h3> 2. The pExTra reporter gene </h3> <p>When we induce expression of a gene in order to investigate its effects, it is important to confirm that the gene is indeed being expressed. This is particularly important when the expression of a gene does not result in any observable change in phenotype. Typically, gene expression is confirmed by monitoring the levels of protein that accumulate in the cell by a technique known as Western blotting. This approach, however, is cumbersome and not suitable for the scope of our research, in which very many different genes will be expressed. Instead, a convenient strategy to monitor expression is by using a second gene, under the control of the same promoter, that produces an easily observable phenotype when expressed. Such genes are known as reporter genes, as they act to “report” on promoter activity. Commonly used reporter genes include genes encoding for fluorescent proteins that can change the color of the cell, or antibiotic resistance genes that allow cells to grow in the presence of antibiotics.</p> <p>To monitor the expression of a phage gene, the pExTra plasmid has been engineered to contain a reporter gene encoding for the red fluorescent protein mCherry downstream of the phage gene. If transcription from the Tet promoter occurs, both genes will be co-transcribed as a single mRNA but will be translated as two separate proteins—the phage gene product and mCherry. Accumulation of the mCherry protein turns cells pink, providing a clear readout of whether or not the transcript is being produced and thus providing some indication as to whether or not the phage gene product of interest is being produced.</p> <h3> Assessing the effects of phage gene expression on host phenotype </h3> <p>The pExTra expression system allows us to both control and monitor expression of a particular phage gene in its native host cell environment, but how can we detect and measure a gene-mediated change in host phenotype? This requires the use of a phenotypic assay, or an experiment designed to evaluate a specific host characteristic. In SEA-GENES research, we will be performing two phenotypic assays on <i>M. smegmatis</i> transformed with a recombinant pExTra plasmid:<br> 1. a Cytotoxicity Assay, and <br> 2. a Superinfection Immunity Assay.</p> <h3> 1. Cytotoxicity Assay </h3> <p>The first phenotypic assay is a cytotoxicity assay, which measures the effect of phage gene expression on the ability of <i>M. smegmatis</i> to grow; a gene product that slows or prevents bacterial growth is said to be ‘toxic’ and likely interferes with some essential cellular process. Identifying toxic phage gene products is not only important for our understanding of how phages interact with their bacterial hosts but is also a key step in the scientific endeavor to develop new antibacterial therapeutics. We already know of some phage gene products that are toxic to bacteria, for example, the holin and lysin proteins that work in concert to lyse the cell; however, within the vast unexplored phage sequence space, there are certain to be many novel mechanisms by which phage gene products disrupt cellular function.</p> <h3> 2. Defense Assay </h3> <p>The second phenotypic assay is a defense test which determines whether expression of a phage gene in <i>M. smegmatis</i> can protect the cell from infection by the phage that encodes the gene. An example of defense, called superinfection immunity, typically occurs through the same mechanism that enables a phage to form a lysogen. During lysogeny, the phage immunity repressor gene is expressed, and the immunity repressor proteins bind to and represses expression of phage genes required for the lytic cycle. When a second or similar phage infects the lysogen, the repressor proteins in the cell can similarly repress expression from the second phage, thereby providing “immunity” to the second infection. Many immunity repressors can confer this immunity when expressed by themselves without other phage-encoded functions. Genes encoding for immunity repressor proteins have not yet been identified in many temperate mycobacteriophage genomes, and even those that have been bioinformatically predicted are poorly characterized. Performing a defense assay provides important experimental validation of this prediction and can be used to inform and improve genome annotation methods. Furthermore, not only immunity repressors are capable of protecting bacterial hosts from infection; other phage gene products have been shown to prevent infection by closely related phages by a variety of mechanisms, including blocking the phage receptor or inhibiting DNA entry. Thus, this phenotypic assay may reveal novel genes involved in such phage-phage interactions. </p> <p>The recombinant pExTra plasmid you have constructed could be used in any number of phenotypic assays to observe gene-mediated effects on different host processes. Key to the interpretation of results from any of these assays, though, is the inclusion of appropriate experimental controls; it is essential to compare the behavior of <i>M. smegmatis</i> cells transformed with the pExTra plasmid of interest in these assays in the presence or absence of inducer, in order to draw any conclusions as to whether phage gene expression is responsible for an observed effect.</p> <h3> Genome-wide analysis of gene-mediated phenotypic effects </h3> <p>Combined, the recombinant pExTra plasmids built by you and your fellow researchers form a gene library, or a collection of individual genes cloned into an expression plasmid, that represents most or all of the genetic material in a particular phage genome. Together, you will perform phenotypic assays on the genes in this library, thereby screening the phage genome to identify the small subset of genes that have particular effects on the host phenotype. This collective analysis provides a genome-wide view of phage gene function, and as more and more of these phage gene libraries are built and screened, we can also begin to make comparisons between related genes within the broader phage population. Doing research at scale increases the chances of discovering promising leads to pursue in future research studies while using only a few experimental methods. </p> <p>Gaining a thorough understanding of how a gene functions in the context of a phage infection, is a large undertaking, requiring the integration of ample data collected by many different methods. The data generated by you and your fellow researchers from the phenotypic assays outlined in this chapter provide important experimental observations that can lead to new hypotheses and get us a few steps closer to better understanding how these genes function in nature!</p> "

Once transformed, bacterial cells store and replicate the plasmid as it does its own genetic material. In molecular cloning, plasmids that are assembled in vitro, for example by isothermal assembly or DNA ligation, are transformed into bacteria so that the plasmid can be replicated. Transformed bacteria, when grown to high densities, can therefore be used to generate large quantities of plasmid DNA, which can subsequently be extracted. Transformations are also an important technique for introducing specific genes into bacteria in order to study gene function. </p> <p> In electroporation, plasmid DNA is mixed with bacterial cells. This mixture is then placed in a special container, called an electroporation cuvette, before being pulsed with an electric current. This electric shock allows plasmid DNA to enter cells. When compared to chemical transformations, transformation by electroporation occurs at a much higher efficiency. </p> <p> During a transformation reaction, not all bacterial cells will be transformed with DNA. However, those bacteria that have been transformed with plasmid DNA can readily be selected based on antibiotic resistance conferred by the plasmid. To select transformed bacteria, bacterial cells from the transformation reaction are allowed to grow for an hour such that transformed cells begin expressing the antibiotic resistance gene, and all cells are then plated on agar supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic.

      "content": "<p> Gene products rarely function in isolation, and the vast majority of biological processes depend upon physical contact between protein molecules. Cellular proteins can work together in pairs or may act as part of larger complexes involving many different proteins. Uncovering the protein partners a given protein is able to bind to, or ‘interact’ with, can provide valuable insight into the biological function of that protein, linking that protein to known cellular processes and proteins with well-defined functions. In this chapter, you will further explore the functions of a subset of phage genes, investigating the ability of their products to interact with proteins found in the M. smegmatis proteome. Since many phage proteins are expected to interact with host proteins as part of the phage infection cycle, the identification of an interaction between a phage protein and a host protein may provide further insight into the role of that gene in the phage life cycle and generate new hypotheses for future study. </p> <p> There are several experimental approaches available to study the protein-protein interactions (PPIs), either in vivo (inside the cell) or in vitro (outside the cell, often using purified proteins). Each approach has its own benefits and pitfalls, but all of these techniques require an observable readout that allows one to detect that an interaction has occurred. A widely used experimental system to study PPIs in vivo is the 2-hybrid assay, in which a physical interaction between two specific proteins produced in a cell activates a specific reporter gene. This reporter gene confers a specific characteristic, or phenotype, to the cell and thus allows the PPI to be monitored. Many different 2-hybrid systems are available to study PPIs, most of which use fast-growing microorganisms such as yeast or E. coli and a variety of reporter gene readouts. The version of the 2-hybrid assay that will be utilized as part of SEA-GENES research is a bacterial 2-hybrid (B2H) assay, which was developed for use in E. coli cells. There are several key features of this B2H system, which are described below. </p> <h3>Reporter Genes </h3> <p> The B2H system employs a specially engineered strain of E. coli, called B2H SELECT, that encodes 2 reporter genes: bla, which encodes for beta-lactamase, an enzyme that breaks down beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillin or carbenicillin, and lacZ, which encodes for beta-galactosidase, an enzyme that breaks down lactose. When these reporter genes are expressed in the bacterial cell, beta-lactamase enables that bacterial cell to grow on media supplemented with the antibiotic carbenicllin, while beta-galactosidase enables that bacterial cell to degrade a chemical analog of lactose, called X-gal, which then turns the bacterial cell blue. Thus, expression of the reporter genes in bacterial cells is easily detected because those cells are able to form colonies, which turn blue, on medium supplemented with carbenicllin and X-gal. On the other hand, cells in which the reporter genes are not expressed should not be able to form colonies due to their sensitivity to carbenicllin.</p> <h3>Test Promoter for the Regulation of Reporter Genes</h3> <p> In order for the B2H assay to act as a reliable indicator of protein-binding in the cell, expression of the reporter genes must be regulated such that it is only activated as a result of a PPI occurring in the cell. This is achieved through the use of a specially engineered promoter, known as a 'test' promoter, to control the transcription of both reporter genes. The test promoter is considered a ‘weak’ promoter because by itself, RNA polymerase is not able to stably bind and initiate transcription; thus, only negligible reporter gene expression can occur. However, this test promoter was engineered to contain an additional regulatory feature that can stabilize RNA polymerase at the test promoter, thereby allowing for transcription of the reporter genes to occur in a PPI-dependent manner. </p> <h3> Regulating the Test Promoter </h3> <p> The regulatory feature of the B2H test promoter is a binding site, or operator, for a specific DNA-binding protein, the CI (pronounced ‘see one’) immunity repressor protein of phage lambda. The CI operator is situated upstream of the test promoter, such that when CI is bound to its operator site, it is in close proximity to any RNA polymerase molecule that contacts the test promoter. If operator-bound CI and RNA polymerase are able to physically interact, RNA polymerase binding at the test promoter is stabilized, thereby activating transcription of the reporter genes. Importantly, though, at this test promoter, CI and RNA polymerase are not normally able to interact with one another. However, if CI and RNA polymerase are each fused to proteins that are able to interact with one another, then an interaction between the CI-fusion protein and RNA polymerase-fusion protein can bridge the gap between these proteins, stabilizing RNA polymerase at the test promoter, and turning on expression of bla and lacZ. Thus, to test if two proteins can interact with one another in the B2H assay, one protein is fused to CI and the other to RNA polymerase. If cells expressing these fusion proteins grow and turn blue in the presence of carbenicllin and X-gal, then the two proteins likely interact; if no growth is observed, it is likely that those two proteins do not interact with one another. </p> <h3> Expressing Fusion Proteins </h3> To test for PPIs, the proteins of interests must first be expressed as fusions to CI or to a subunit of RNA polymerase. Each fusion protein is expressed as a single polypeptide encoded by two different genes that have been joined together. For the purposes of generating these fusion proteins, two plasmids were specifically engineered: <ul role = 'list'> <li> p2H&alpha; plasmid, cloned using the protocols outlined in Chapter 2, such that it can be expressed as a fusion to a portion of the &alpha; subunit of RNA polymerase, and</li> <li> pCI plasmid, which encodes random fragments of M. smegmatis genes that will be produced as a fusion to the CI protein. </li> </ul> <p> Both p2H&alpha; and pCI plasmids contain inducible promoters to regulate the production of the fusion proteins they encode. Note that both plasmids contain the same negatively regulated inducible promoter, ‘Lac*’. Like the pExTra 'Tet' promoter, which is maintained in the 'off' state when bound by the Tetracycline-repressor protein, TetR, the Lac* promoter, is maintained in the 'off' state when bound by the transcriptional regulator LacI. The Lac* promoter is turned “on” by the addition of the inducer lactose or a lactose mimic known as Isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, or IPTG. When either inducer binds LacI, it causes a conformational change that releases the regulator from the DNA and allows RNA polymerase to bind and activate transcription of the downstream fusion genes. The reporter strain B2H SELECT encodes the LacI regulator, which is constitutively produced, ensuring that fusion proteins under the control of the Lac* promoter are not expressed until the IPTG inducer is introduced into the experimental system. </p> <h3> Selecting for PPIs </h3> <p> To perform the B2H assay, a p2Ha plasmid is used to transform B2H SELECT E. coli cells containing a pCI plasmid. Once transformed, IPTG is added to the cells, inducing expression of both fusion proteins encoded by these plasmids: a phage gene of interest is expressed from the p2H&alpha; plasmid as a fusion to a portion of the &alpha; subunit of RNA polymerase (&alpha;-phage gene) and a M. smegmatis gene fragment fused to CI (CI-host gene fragment) is expressed from the pCI plasmid. If the phage protein of interest is able to interact with a particular M. smegmatis protein fragment, that interaction will activate expression of the reporter genes in that particular cell. In the absence of an interaction, no reporter gene expression occurs. </p> <p> The M. smegmatis genome encodes ~ 9,000 different proteins. Assessing whether a phage gene product is able to interact with each of these host proteins, one-by-one, would be very labor and time-intensive. Instead, to determine which of these proteins, if any, interact with a phage protein of interest, the B2H assay has been developed to rapidly test for pairwise interactions between the phage protein of interest and a collection of ~ 1 million different M. smegmatis protein fragments cloned into a pCI gene fusion library. The B2H SELECT strain containing this pCI library is transformed with a p2H&alpha; plasmid; in the presence of IPTG, each E. coli cell produces the same &alpha;-phage gene fusion but a different CI-host gene fragment fusion. The bla reporter gene used in the B2H assay enables us to perform a genetic selection; a million transformed cells can be plated on selective medium containing IPTG and carbenicillin, and only the subset of those cells in which bla is being expressed from the test promoter due to a phage-host PPI should be able to survive. Thus, we can quickly ‘select’ for candidate interaction partners from a large pool of host protein fragments. The second reporter gene, lacZ, acts as an additional indicator that expression is occurring from the test promoter in surviving colonies as these should turn blue on selection plates containing X-gal. </p> <h3> Validating Hits </h3> <p> Ideally, after performing a B2H selection assay we will isolate carbenicillin-resistant colonies in which a biologically relevant PPI triggers expression of the bla and lacZ reporter genes. However, 2-hybrid assays can produce both false negative and false positive results. Some proteins may not be properly folded or stable when produced in the non-native context of the E. coli cytoplasm, or fusion to another large protein domain may interfere with the ability of a protein to bind its normal interaction partner. Thus, even if a phage protein does have a biologically important binding partner in the M. smegmatis proteome, we may not be able to identify it in our system. Furthermore, some colonies isolated in the B2H selection may be resistant to carbenicillin for reasons other than the presence of a true PPI. Three possible types of false positive results are described below. </p> <ul role = 'list'> <li> Some B2H Select E. coli cells may have acquired a random mutation on the chromosome that confers resistance to carbenicillin. In most cases, this class of mutants should be easily identifiable since they will not be expressing the reporter genes and therefore form colonies that are white rather than blue.</li> <li> Some B2H Select E. coli cells may have acquired a mutation in the test promoter, such that expression of the reporter genes is constitutive, and happens in the absence of a PPI.</li> <li> Some B2H Select E. coli cells may express ‘sticky’ CI protein fusions that are able to interact non-specifically with the phage protein or even RNA polymerase itself. </li> </ul> <p> After isolating a carbenicillin-resistant colony in our B2H selection, we must perform downstream analyses to try to distinguish between a true PPI candidate and potential false positives. We can use a diagnostic PCR to detect ‘sticky’ CI fusion fragments that appear repeatedly in selections with different phage proteins and eliminate them from our pool of candidate interaction partners. To further validate a PPI, the p2H&alpha; and pCI plasmids can be extracted from a colony that survives the B2H selection. Doing so isolates the plasmids expressing the two candidate interacting proteins away from chromosomal or test promoter mutations that may be present in that particular carbenicillin-resistant cell. When a new batch of B2H SELECT cells is transformed with the isolated plasmids, a genuine PPI should result in all transformants being able to survive a B2H selection. </p> <p> Once we have confirmed that growth on carbenicillin is due to an interaction between a phage gene product fusion and host protein fusion, we can sequence the pCI plasmid to identify the host interaction partner. Gaining a full understanding of the biological significance of this PPI and how it relates to the function of the phage gene product will take additional work, beyond the scope of one semester. Importantly, though, these interaction analyses will undoubtedly reveal important clues in our quest to understand gene function and will create new lines of research for phage biologists to explore! </p>"

      "content": "<h3>Objective:</h3> <p>To perform a bacterial 2-hybrid selection in order to identify potential protein-protein interactions between a phage gene product of interest and host proteins.</p> <h4>Rationale: </h4> <p>In this protocol, a bacterial two-hybrid system is used to rapidly assay the pairwise interactions between a phage gene product of interest and a plasmid gene library encoding for roughly a million different fragments of the ~7,000 proteins in the <em>M. smegmatis </em>proteome. The 2-hybrid analysis is performed in a special <em>E. coli </em>reporter strain, B2H SELECT, containing a test promoter that controls the expression of two reporter genes, <em>bla</em>, which encodes for the carbenicillin-resistance factor beta-lactamase, and <em>lacZ</em> , which encodes for the enzyme beta-galactosidase; this strain is transformed with two plasmids encoding the two 'hybrid' fusion proteins. The phage gene is expressed from the p2H&alpha; plasmid as a fusion to a subunit of <em>E. coli</em> RNA polymerase while each host protein fragment is expressed from a different pCI plasmid as a fusion to the CI DNA-binding protein. This library of pCI plasmids was previously transformed into the B2H SELECT reporter strain to generate the B2H SELECT/pCI-SMEG Library electrocompetent cells used in this protocol. In each aliquot of these cells there are about a billion different cells, each transformed with one of the million different pCI plasmids. You will trasnform these cells with the p2H&alpha; plasmid of interest by electroporation and plate them on special selective medium containing antibiotics to maintain selection of the plasmids, IPTG to induce production of the fusion proteins, X-gal to monitor<em> lacZ</em> expression, and a high concentration of carbenicillin; out of the fraction of competent cells that took up the p2H&alpha; plasmid, those that express two interacting fusion proteins will be able to activate expression of <em>bla</em> and survive in the presence of carbenicillin. These colonies should also be blue due to the activation of<em> lacZ</em> expression and the presence of the colored substrate X-gal in the selective medium; note, though, that the amount of blueness observed can vary from colony to colony. This 'selection' of colonies in which a potential protein-protein interaction is occuring works best when about a million transformed cells are grown on a plate, thus ensuring that many or most of the possible ~1 million different pairwise interactions have been tested. </p> <p><br> <h4>Supplies:</h4></p> <ul role = 'list'> <li>B2H SELECT/pCI-SMEG Library electrocompetent cells</li> <li>Plasmid DNA for the p2H&alpha; plasmid expressing the phage gene fusion of interest</li> <li>Ice</li> <li>Microcentrifuge tubes</li> <li>Recovery broth (LB broth without any antibiotics)</li> <li>IPTG solution (10 mM)</li> <li>B2H Selection plates</li> <li>B2H Growth plates</li> <li>Rattler beads or spreader, with 100 % EtOH</li> <li>Shaking incubator set to 37 <b>°</b>C</li> <li>Electroporation cuvettes (gap: 0.1 cm)</li> <li>Electroporator (voltage: 1.8 kV)</li> <li>Paper towel or KimWipe</li> <li>Plate incubator set to 30 ºC </li> </ul> <h4>Procedure :</h4> <strong>Important:</strong>Competent cells should be kept on ice throughout Steps A and B.<br> </p> <ol role = 'list' style='list-style-type:upper-alpha;'> <li>Set up the transformation reaction.<br> <strong>Note:</strong> The number of transformation reactions and the volume of competent cells used in the transformation reaction will depend on the competency of your bacterial cells, and should be discussed with your instructor. <ol role = 'list'> <li>Place the followwing three items on ice: <ul role = 'list'> <li>an aliquot of frozen B2H SELECT/pCI-SMEG Library electrocompetent cells </li> <li>recombinant p2H&alpha; plasmid DNA encoding your gene of interest on ice to chill</li> <li>an electroporation cuvette</li> </ul> </li> <li>The transformation reaction is optimized for 100 ng of plasmid DNA.

In addition to the putative protein-protein interaction colonies, these selection plates may also contain colonies that are carbenicillin-resistant for less interesting reasons. For example, some cells may have randomly acquired a chromosomal mutation that confers resistance to carbenicillin; colonies that are completely white or very tiny may fall into this class. Furthermore, some survivng cells may harbor a mutation in the test promoter that allows for constitutive expression of the bla and lacZ reporter genes. Finally, some protein fragments may be 'sticky' and able to interact with many different phage proteins or even E. coli RNA polymerase itself. These last two classes of carbenicillin-surviving colonies are harder to distinguish as they will lead to healthy, blue colonies just like a true protein-protien interaction. In this protocol, colonies will be screened by colony PCR for known 'sticky' CI fusion proteins such that they can be eliminated from the pool of hits. In Protocol 4.3, the remaining candidates will be analyzed further to determine whether the ability to grow on carbenicillin is due to the expression of interacting partners or some type of mutation in the reporter strain. </p> <p> <h4>Supplies:</h4></p> <ul role = 'list'> <li>B2H Selection plates on which 500,000 to 5 million transformed cells were plated and incubated at 30 ºC for 48 h </li> <li>LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml Kanamycin, 25 μg/ml Chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml Spectinomycin</li> <li>Sterile test tubes with lids</li> <li>Sterile innoculation or wooden sticks</li> <li>Temperature-controlled shaking incubator or rotor</li> <li>5 ml serological pipettes</li> <li>Pipette aid</li> <li>Microcentrifuge tubes</li> <li>Microcentrifuge</li> <li>Plasmid mini-prep Kit (Zymo)</li> <li>Sterile, nuclease-free water</li> <li>PCR tubes</li> <li>2X One Taq Polymerase Master Mix</li> <li>DNA Primers (10 μM)</li> <li>Ice</li> <li>Sterile, nuclease-free water</li> <li>Thermocycler</li> </ul> <h4>Procedure :</h4> <ol role = 'list' style='list-style-type:upper-alpha;'> <li> Inoculate liquid cultures. <ol role = 'list'> <li> After recording observations on the number, color, and size of colonies on the B2H Selection plate, follow Protocol 2.11, to inoculate a culture for each colony on the plate. <ol role = 'list' start='1' style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'> <li>Colonies should be grown in LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml Kanamycin, 25 μg/ml Chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml Spectinomycin.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Cultures should be grown at 30 ºC, with shaking, for 16-24 h. </li> </ol> </li> <li>Screen candidates for known 'sticky' fragments by PCR <ol role = 'list'> <li>Prepare template DNA. <ol role = 'list' start='1' style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'> <li>Obtain and label a new microcentrifuge tube for each sample to be tested.</li> <li>Aseptically transfer 100 &micro;l of each culture to the labelled tubes.

The Liquid Cycle is programmed to release the chamber pressure slowly at the endof the cycle, which prevents your super-heated liquids from rapidly bubbling over.</span></li><li><span><strong>Wrapped (or Vacuum) Cycle</strong>: Most consumables and glassware used,as well as biohazard waste generated, should be sterilized in an autoclave using the Wrapped (or Vacuum)Cycle. This cycle mechanically replaces the air in the chamber with steam, which allows the steam to accessareas where air may otherwise be trapped (e.g. pipette tip boxes). Note that this cycle is notpre-programmed to release chamber pressure slowly, and should not be used for liquids.</span></li><li><span><span><strong>Unwrapped (or Gravity) Cycle</strong>:Unwrapped utensils can be sterilized using this cycle. Unlike the Wrapped Cycle, the Unwrapped cycleuses gravity to displace the air in the chamber. As such, air trapped in containers (e.g. pipette tipboxes) may not be replaced with steam, limiting sterilization.</span></span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><h3>Cycle temperature and duration:</h3></span></p><ul><li><strong>Liquids:</strong> Liquids should be autoclaved at 121 ˚C (250 ˚F). The cycle duration varies dependingon the amount of liquid being autoclaved. As a rule, 500 ml of liquid should be autoclaved for 40 mins. An extra5 minutes should be added to the overall duration for each additional 500 ml of liquid.</li><li><strong>Non-liquids:</strong> Most consumables and glassware used, as well as biohazard waste generated, shouldbe sterilized in an autoclave set at 121 ˚C (250 ˚F) for 20 mins.</li></ul>"
